<title>Only Britain Fails to Soldier On</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230209 - Only Britain Fails to Soldier On.mp3</link>
<description>There's a rumor circulating that Liz Truss may be making a comeback. Well, she might think so--and she's written an article about it. We review this excellent piece of writing line-by-line, as well as addressing some coin-minting antipathy from a weird Canadian columnist that Riley found. We very much hope you enjoy.</description>

<title>Where The Boys Are feat. Mattie Lubchansky</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230207 - Where The Boys Are feat. Mattie Lubchansky.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
We brought on friend of the show and extremely good cartoonist Mattie Lubchansky (@lubchansky) to discuss their new book BOYS WEEKEND. They wanted to register a website for the book at boysweekend.com, but it’s been parked on by a group of guys who’ve been having boys’ weekends since 2000. And posting about it on a very web 1.0 site. So, cleary we had to talk about it, as well as more AI-related news, and much more.
Check out the actual site for BOYS WEEKEND here, and preorder a copy: www.boysweekend.biz</description>

<title>FBI Anime Girlfriend Chatbot feat. Paris Marx</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230203 - FBI Anime Girlfriend Chatbot feat. Paris Marx.mp3</link>
<description>This week, we're speaking with Paris Marx (@parismarx) of the Tech Won't Save Us podcast about recent developments in AI--the grift moving from web 3.0 to artificial intelligence, the idea that anything is good enough so long as it automates people out of a job, and much more. Hope you enjoy!

<title>AmeriCOIN feat. Joe Weisenthal</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230131 - AmeriCOIN feat. Joe Weisenthal.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
This week, we speak with Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) of the Bloomberg dot com Odd Lots podcast about minting the coin. But not just any coin: a strange loophole in a ’90s law designed to let the U.S. Mint produce collectors’ coins basically means that, if they wanted to, the director could order the Mint to issue a platinum coin of any denomination. Two dollars. Ten million dollars. One trillion dollars. But will the Democrats use this to completely undercut Republican debt ceiling brinkmanship? Probably not?

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230126 - No True Starmer feat. Abi Thorn.mp3</link>
<description>Abi Thorn (@PhilosophyTube) joins Riley, Milo, and Alice for a mostly dessert episode today! (Hussein continues to recover from a wasting disease, and will be back soon). In the mean time we’ve got news, startups, more Elon nonsense, and then to top it off we try to elucidate  “Starmerism” as a political theory, rather than just a media management strategy.</description>

<title>Britainology 53: Blue Peter</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230120 - Britainology 53_ Blue Peter.mp3</link>
<description>For this month's first Britainology, Nate and Milo examine a BBC children's show that has been running since the 1950s, despite no one watching it. The show is called Blue Peter, it's extremely boring, it feels like it's been taken out of a different era, and yes, there are allegations of adultery and drug use (it's Britain after all!) Hope you enjoy.</description>

<title>Trashfuture Avanti West Coast feat. Gareth Dennis</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20230119 - Trashfuture Avanti West Coast feat. Gareth Dennis.mp3</link>
<description>This week’s bonus features writer and rail engineer Gareth Dennis (@GarethDennis), host of the Rail Natter YouTube show, discussing the current state of British trains. The Tories are ideologically opposed to state capacity, sure, that’s table stakes, but did you know that Labour also promise to not fix the unavoidable problems with the UK’s rail network? Shocking, we realise. Also, we discuss a mental health startup.

<description>For this week's bonus, the nearly-full cast of Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Alice speak with technology publicist and crypto sceptic Ed Zitron about the current state of the cryptocurrency market--of course it's a scam, everyone knows that, but just how much is it on the precipice? The answer will probably not shock you, but might unsettle you regardless. Hope you enjoy!

<description>It’s the free one!
The gang says goodbye to Matt Hancock MP, the fabulous app where we all met for the first time. Also, a real use for NFT's finally discovered. Mostly, though, we face up to a grim reality: the society of universal services that defined the postwar period has now fundamentally broken. Predictably, the worst people in the country are all scratching their heads and asking how it happened.

<description>For this week's bonus, here's the live show we barely remember. It was our first show of the tour in Australia, we were jet lagged to the end of the earth, Milo was out sick with tummy trouble, and we were joined with special guest and friend of the show Aidan 'Taco' Jones to discuss... a spite cube. And a niche kind of Australian vehicle theft where you tell everyone exactly what you're about to do. This show took place at Good Chat in Brisbane on November 7, 2022. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<description>It’s the free one!
Riley, Milo, and Alice ring in the new year by looking at the Economist’s rosy predictions in an alternate universe where Britain magically becomes fine due to the power of positive thinking and sharp dressing. We also look at some developments in Scotland, and Labour’s plan to give every homeowner control of Trident to deal with the rampant issue of young people loitering. Finally, we round off by looking at a new Yacht Neom DLC.

Here’s a hint: it starts with an “O” and rhymes with an “Blorganised Labour.”</description>

However, rest assured that we talk about the book for about half of this interview, and the other half is a masterclass on process where we learn how Adrian comes up with columns such as 'I recently saw something in a petrol station toilet southbound on the M1 that I can never unsee.'

<description>This week, we're talking to Mike Isaac of the New York Times about Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. And, let's be real, his desire to be loved, his insane right wing tendencies, the slow grinding of the platform into the ground, and the bizarre tech-libertarian freak thought undergirding all of the PayPal Mafia's conception of the world. This is part two of two!</description>

<description>It's the free one!
Elon Musk is (maybe?) buying Twitter again, but more importantly, the conversations between him and a number of his doofus friends and associates have been disclosed. We look into the Mind of Musk, and speculate about his grand plans for the future of humanity via posting. We end on a charming article about McKinsey and the tobacco industry.

This week, Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Alice join special guest and friend of the show Jathan Sadowski (@jathansadowski) of the This Machine Kills podcast (@machinekillspod) to discuss microfinance. Despite the Nobel Prizes involved, it turns out it’s just app-connected loan sharking in many ways. We also discuss a mental health app that provides crowdsourced therapy. Is it licensed?

However, before we can talk about that, we have to talk about a startup that wants to build sea pods, presumably so that you can pay rent to a sealord.</description>

<description>We bring on journalist Ian MacDougall to discuss the libertarian intentional-community of Prospera, a failing city-state in the Bay Islands of Honduras, where Thiel- and Andreessen-funded weirdos have tried to create a land where anyone can open a business with any law, from any jurisdiction, anywhere, adjudicated by some guys in Arizona.

<description>This week it’s Milo, Hussein, Nate, and Alice, joined by special guest Mattie Lubchansky (@lubchansky), and we’re discussing the UK’s energy pricing woes. Which are solely related to privatisation. Which everyone can see coming and nobody is going to do anything about. We also discuss an app-connected water bottle that sometimes tells you to drink enough water to kill you if its sensors are off.
There’s a special smart segment in this episode in which Riley speaks with Dr Craig Berry about the disasters of privatised pensions. If you enjoy this discussion, Craig’s book is available here: https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pensions-imperilled-9780198782834?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;</description>

There may be disruptions in the free-money-forever ecosystem of the tech industry, but that hasn’t stopped new ideas springing forth. For example: what if we made an AI chatbot but it had feelings?

For this month's second Britainology, Milo makes Nate watch season 1, episode 1 of the Channel 4 teen comedy/drama 'Skins.' Nicholas Hoult is in demon twink mode causing chaos all around flip-phone-era Bristol c. 2007, and Nate marvels at the fact that a show like this would have been much harder to make for network TV in the US back in those days.

We continue to follow the incipient strike wave in Britain now spreading to other industries, and think about how the veil between ourselves and a more livaeble, dignified existence is once again at its thinnest. We also discuss Labour’s manifest inability to rise to the moment… and then we delve into the mountains of madness with an article about how Glastonbury should be replaced with a Ukrainian army recruitment centre.

But first, we look at a startup back from the dead, think about the on-purpose recession that the global north is about to tip into and (thinking about other recessions), what we can expect, and how the IMF created political monsters it can no longer control.

<title>Automobile Conversation Part 2 of 2 ft. Victoria Scott</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220526 - Automobile Conversation Part 2 of 2 ft. Victoria Scott.mp3</link>
<description>This week, we're joined by auto journalist Victoria Scott (@mikurubaeahina) about new developments in automotive surveillance. As in: what if your car was the cops, recorded everything you ever did in the car, was accessible by the other cops via forensic devices, could be monitored without a warrant, and had no option for you to shut this off? Well, apparently that's 90&#37; of cars made since 2008 already.</description>

<description>The gang discusses the inevitable crypto crash, tether, and the charlatans who sold ordinary people down the river. We also review Britain’s strategy for dealing with its many overlapping crises including mental health. Then, we speak to journalist Heidi Swart, whose work for the MIT technology review is all about how the surveillance industry is slowly rebuilding apartheid in South Africa.

<title>School’s Out For Rapture ft. Josh Boerman</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220510 - School’s Out For Rapture ft. Josh Boerman.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
Josh Boerman from The Worst of All Possible Worlds joins the entire gang to discuss the Christian Dominionist designs on American society through the lens of the "school choice" campaign led by, among others, West Michigan's very own Betsy DeVos. We look at parallels between similar movements here, and how they link to other demands made by the same people.
The Worst of All Possible Worlds (@TWOAPW) is a weekly podcast of case studies in the pop culture of a dying empire. Co-hosts Josh (@boshj) and Brian (@spocks_brian) grew up evangelical in Michigan and New Mexico, while A.J. (@thefuzzymask) grew up Catholic in California. Together, we deconstruct how narrative and artistic choices in popular media reflect or subvert the ongoing reactionary project in contemporary America and the world at large.

<description>Last week, we had a 2018-throwback lineup of the TF cast for a live show in London featuring Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Nate. We've got it all: Ed Balls returning to politics, a succession of blockchain-related nonsense startups, and a tremendous column by a Telegraph writer who's furious at the concept of work from home because it makes people 'mediocre.' We think you will enjoy this.</description>

But first, we look at the new energy “strategy” and a collective translatlantic failure to address the crises of our day. Also Riley saw another car.</description>

<description>This week, we’re talking about a mental-health startup that’s even worse than the man made horrors you thought were beyond your comprehension, some particularly spicy UK legal news, and a simple request for people to be honest about what they actually want, politically. Hope you enjoy!

<title>Britainology 33: Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220321 - Britainology 33_ Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em.mp3</link>
<description>For the first Britainology of March, Nate and Milo watch a *terrible* British sitcom from the 1970s that has, somehow, endured. That's right, we've been Frank Spencerpilled--we've watched Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, and we're still shaken from the 'what if Britain was in the Eastern Bloc' vision that it portrayed. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<description>We bring back friend of the show Quantian1 to discuss sanctions against Russia, how the global financial system can shut out a large economy (and how economic integration doesn't necessarily mean less chance of conflict), how the conflict will affect food prices, and our theory that, instead of sanctions, we should just do a Reverse Salisbury on Putin.</description>

<description>It's the free one!
It’s the True Chaos Configuration of Milo, Hussein, and Alice, and we’re discussing the Festival of Brexit–a bizarre idea that seems to be at least competently executed, much to our surprise. However, it includes a techno festival called Tour de Moon with an intensely 2000s website that has to be seen to be believed. We also talk about sanctioning Abramovich, and much more.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220311 - Refuse of the Future_ Challenges in Geopolitics from Metternich to the 22nd Century.mp3</link>
<description>Dr. Riley Quinn (DPhil International Relations), Dr. Milo Edwards (PhD Russian Language), and Maj. Alice Caldwell-Kelly (OSINT specialist) introduce another “garden of forking paths” version of ourselves. We also discuss the bipartisan consensus that spiking energy prices (which have been spiking long before the war) are good and worth the Blitz spirit. Also, another article and Lebedev/Johnson hanging out pretending to be homeless to raise awareness.</description>

<title>The Lithium Rush ft. Thea Riofrancos</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220308 - The Lithium Rush ft. Thea Riofrancos.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
Riley, Alice, and Milo look at the ongoing descent of the UK pundit class into embodying the global death drive, and take a look at a story of a certain kind of British Guy achieving apotheosis (spending £218 of Bolton Council's money meant for excluded children at the Spar in Praia du Luz in Portugal). In between, Riley talks to academic Thea Riofrancos about why "onshoring" mining is all the rage now that the world's security and energy orders have both been thrown into disarray.
Read Thea’s article on mining here (paywalled): https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/07/renewable-energy-transition-critical-minerals-mining-onshoring-lithium-evs-climate-justice/</description>

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220301 - Trans-Atlanticism feat. Abigail Thorn.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
This week, friend of the show Abigail Thorn (@PhilosophyTube) joins us to discuss the EHRC’s turn towards belligerent transphobia. One might go so far as to say that they’ve violated Riley’s Law, but there’s an American dimension: British transphobia is beginning to appear in American legal statutes, cited approvingly. Seems bad! We also discuss an app to buy your way into government? And some admittedly out-of-date reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (we recorded this on the day it started).

<description>For this week's bonus, we discuss the UK ending all COVID testing, the NYT/Serial 'Trojan Horse Affair' podcast making British columnists lose their minds, an update on Roku's hilarious financial peril, and a long rumination on what would happen if Keir Starmer took Julia Fox on a date.

<description>It's the free one!
This week, Nate and Hussein speak with Brian Reed and Hamza Syed of the Trojan Horse Affair podcast, an investigation into a hoax letter in Birmingham in 2014 that–despite being known to be false–kicked off an intensification of surveillance and mistreatment of British Muslims. And everyone knew it was fake at the time!
It is the official position of Trashfuture that you listen to the Trojan Horse Affair, which is available here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/podcasts/trojan-horse-affair.html
Also, this episode was recorded before the Observer decided to make up imaginary vibes-based critiques of the show (it was recorded last week).</description>

<description>Now unlocked to the $5 tier!
Nate and Milo watched the early-2000s UK TV show 'Road Wars' and talked about British cops, but the episode got derailed with various tales of personal experiences with cops, and how little you can get away with in the US without getting arrested and charged. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<description>In this special extra segment, Nate interviews Sam Asumadu from Media Diversified (@WritersOfColour) about the phenomenon of Indeterminate Sentences for Public Protection (IPPs), a now-banned sentence that has resulted in thousands of British residents effectively receiving life sentences for acts as minor as stealing a mobile phone at age 17. Sam’s written an article on the topic for OpenDemocracy, which is available here: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/families-plea-over-barbaric-indefinite-prison-sentences-for-minor-crimes/

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220118 - Hell Is Other Human Resources ft. Alex Press.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
We are joined by Alex Press (@alexnpress), of Jacobin and the Primer podcast, to do some more Amazonology. This time, we look at the specifics of how HR operates at this company, how its shittiness ends up hurting workers, and how Amazon is gearing up to export more of its working practices to others. But first, we wonder at why and how it was the parties that finally turned the British establishment against Boris Johnson.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20220115 - Britainology 30_ Homes Under the Hammer (feat. Alice Caldwell-Kelly).mp3</link>
<description>Milo subjects Nate to yet another property-themed British TV show, except this one is about people buying derelict homes at auction and renovating them in order to (in most cases) rent them out at huge markup. We brought on Alice Caldwell-Kelly, who described this show as 'like a nature documentary about parasites,' and we have a delightful time.</description>

In which the full cast of TF discusses the BBC bringing on Alan Dershowitz to discuss the Maxwell verdict, and recent fawning coverage of Liz Truss that wants so desperately to make her the next Thatcher.

Jathan and Ed from TMK return to help us figure out exactly what “Web 3” is, and what people actually mean when they say “Web 3.” What we find when we look under the hood is a virtual series of colonia dignidads all layered on top of one another promising that only when we have interpreted Hayek correctly, will we find utopia.</description>

<description>It's the free one!
This week, we have the full cast of TF together to review the history of the Millennium Dome, a New Labour attempt to create a modern exposition of Britain. It definitely became an exhibition of how weird the inner circle of Blair’s Labour was, but it’s largely regarded as a failure–and we learn about how it transformed a chunk of Greenwich from the Goop Zone into the Empty Luxury Flat Zone.</description>

We got Olga Koch (@rocknrolga) on to discuss this and, uh, she did not like it.</description>

<description>It's the free one!
Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg now works for Facebook to the tune of eight figures. He has some opinions about Facebook’s policy decisions. As you can guess, they sound like thoughts from a man who’s been hit in the head really hard–which is why Riley, Milo, and Alice analyze a recent Meta appearance in which his Nintendo Wii-looking avatar complains about his headset a lot, among other things. We also talk about the recent byelection in North Shropshire. Hope you enjoy!</description>

There are a lot of other points covered in this episode but this part really captures something ineffably British. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<description>It's the free one!
This week, we speak with writer and friend of the show Trevor Strunk (@hegelbon) about recent developments in the smartest sector of our very real economy: the gaming/crypto convergence, in which powerful thinkers from Andreesen Horowitz have decided that the best way to develop jobs is to pay people in the developing world a pittance to do XP grinding on behalf of gamers in the developed world. Sounds great to us! We also address the British politics moment surrounding the 2020 Christmas party and why it's superseded coverage of the UK government's new bill that lets them strip citizenship of anyone they choose. Hope you enjoy!

So, to aid with understanding, we got Politics Home editor and cricket enthusiast Alan White (@aljwhite) to explain it to us. That doesn't necessarily mean Nate came away understanding it any more than before, but it was a fun discussion.</description>

<description>Amelia Horgan, author of Lost in Work and striking member of the UK’s higher education Union (UCU) talks about the decade of strikes in the sector, and why the demands are connected to a top level reimagining of what education can be. But first, we look at a few apparently unrelated goings on in Britain and peer into our scrying bowl to look at the outlines of this country’s political future.

<description>Now unlocked to the $5 tier!
Look, this is something of a loose episode because Milo was on tour while we recorded it. However, in an effort to satisfy our urge to explain Britain, we watched the 2016 film GANGSTERS, GAMBLERS AND GEEZERS which is a z-grade British knockoff of Harold and Kumar, features none other than Dave Courtney, and contains some of the worst shit we've ever seen. If we can ever get our hands on the Dave Courtney-directed film GATWICK GANGSTERS, we'll watch it. However, at present, you cannot watch it anywhere--legally or highly illegally--because it has no actual distribution. Sad! Anyway, hope you enjoy.</description>

We speak to Phil Jones, author of Work Without the Worker, about microwork and how AI is fake, and most of it is just tiny tasks done by workers in the global south and dressed up as technology. We get deeper into how exactly how this practice developed, how its economics are rooted in overproduction, and how boosterish liberal institutions cheer-led the whole process.

<description>Facebook and Google haven't done anything new of note since 2007. It's just market capture and worse and worse services. However, Facebook is now Meta or something, and in this bonus episode Riley, Milo, and Alice seek to understand. Also we talk about hitting an ape with a hammer.</description>

We go back into the history of how Britain's railways "got like that," and how government plans to centralise and revitalise Great British Rail is just a coat of red white and blue paint over (you guessed it!) giving money to scammy start ups.</description>

We had journalist Daniel Trilling on the podcast to discuss his research into The Home Office - how it became such a strange, cruel, dysfunctional department, and how it fits into the larger cruel absurdities of immigration policy in western countries. Also, we talk excitedly about Matt Hancock’s new appointment to the UN (…we got the bad news a couple days after recording).

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20211018 - Britainology 25_ The North feat. Rob Smith and Kaye Wiggins.mp3</link>
<description>This week, Nate and Milo discuss the North-South divide of England with help from two friends of the show--and FT reporters--Rob Smith (@bondhack) and Kaye Wiggins (@kayewiggins). Rob is from Derby (technically not in the North, but presumed to be) and Kaye is from Southport (definitely in the North). We discuss their experiences in the South, the fact that Liverpool and Essex have so much in common, and a guide for international students in the UK that offers a doctrinal definition of Northern Monkeys vs Southern Fairies. Hope you enjoy!
Rob and Kaye worked on a piece about financial misadventures in the North that you should check out: https://t.co/YaFREWTHbg?amp=1</description>

Mark Zuckerberg is building the future of the internet, and the future of everything, and it’s basically a much more exploitative version of Habbo Hotel.

And thankfully we've got Jathan Sadowski, friend of the show and cohost of the This Machine Kills Podcast, to explain it further.</description>

And, of course, a lot more. We also revisit some old friends (Bill Gross, Softbank) and a plan for the Tories to send in old army men to "de-woke" the NHS.</description>

<description>Yet again, Riley read a piece of literature nobody else would touch, in order to inflict it on his friends. We read Starmer's Vichy France pamphlet "The Road Ahead" about how he's bounced back and he's a serious politician now, because he has written a 11,500 word essay of inadequate plans.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210923 - Post-Shug Clarity.mp3</link>
<description>We've found another terrible startup: a billion-dollar-valuation 'plastic recycling' venture that is too dangerous to actually work (but would absolve the oil industry of any need to change its business model). It operates via a concept called shugging. It also has yet again involved a promised factory in Ohio that will never exist. Prepare to get shugged.
(Editor's note: this episode has some slightly throwback sounds because Hussein and Milo's mics were, uh, suboptimal. I have done my best!)

<description>This week, Milo, Nate, and Alice watched the 1995 Kathryn Bigelow film STRANGE DAYS, in which Ray Fiennes is a lovelorn memory-salesman hawking minidiscs that let you experience other people's consciousness. It's a bizarre document from the time in which its made, it's a film with cult status in certain quarters, and it posits the notion that to get over your problems, you need Angela Bassett to kick your ass. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210914 - The Winter of Discontented Treat Lovers.mp3</link>
<description>It's the free one!
This week, we’ve got a real doozy for you: a bad startup, some Labour kremlinology, and an examination of supply chain shortages in the UK because our government are some of the dumbest people to ever breathe air. Did you know that when your taxes go up to fund privatization and pocket-stuffing, that’s actually communism? You heard it here first.

<description>Now unlocked to the $5 tier!
This week, Alice joins Nate and Milo to discuss the British reality TV show 'Grand Designs,' in which insane people decide to sacrifice it all to build the house of their dreams. Does it sometimes go okay? Sure. But most of the time, it's a slow-motion wreck with dyspeptic commentary from what we might describe as architecture Jeremy Clarkson. Enjoy!</description>

<description>It's the free one!
Alice and Riley speak with returning guest, journalist Arron Merat (@a_merat), reflecting on twenty years of cruelty and institutional failure on the part of the British state and its bloody imperial adventure in Afghanistan. We look deeper into the domestic pressures, economic and psychological, that made this all happen, and look at some of the attempts to actively forget what we have been doing.

<description>This week we explore the phenomenon of 2000s Indie Rock (and the endless succession of bands that seemed to go nowhere) with two long-suffering veterans of the scene: Fred Macpherson (of the bands Spector, Les Incompétents, and and Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man) and music journalist Oscar Rickett. It's a lot of bad memories but it wouldn't be Britainology if we didn't dredge them up!</description>

<description>It's the free one!
This week, Nate, Milo, Alice, and Hussein speak with journalist Alex Yablon (@alexyablon) about a US program in 2020 where the Federal Reserve leant money to municipalities--and the possibility of cutting out market-based austerity, if we want it. We also check in on Lordstown Motors and read a deeply insane ‘philosophy’ piece about why we should welcome a meteor.

We discuss unionisation drives in Hollywood, why capital concentration is making films worse, the conditions for non-star workers in the US film industry, and an app that's going to redefine your biological age.

<description>We brought on Dan Boeckner, musician from the bands Wolf Parade and Operators, podcaster with Riley from the show Bottlemen, to discuss a 1977 spy thriller called 'Cumbernauld HIT' set in Cumbernauld, Scotland. Except it was funded by the local council to promote Cumbernauld, using the film as a promo for the New Town and all its drab concrete labyrinth glory. Here is the spirit of Labourism, a new model community where society is building a new man who, crucially, does not jack off.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210730 - Britainology 20_ London Finance Geezers feat. Matt Edwards.mp3</link>
<description>This is perhaps something of a combination of Britainology and a regular TF episode in which we've brought on Matt Edwards, Milo's (much) older brother, who worked as a foreign exchange trader in London brokerages in the 1990s. We learn about the geezer-rific work environment of a bunch of guys yelling into a phone about numbers, some of the antics they got up to, what's changed since, and--perhaps on a more serious note--Matt's personal experience with what happened in Greece post-2008, a country he's worked in extensively. We very much hope you enjoy this.</description>

But first, we have a ludicrous startup and a few fun news items to cover (including yet another supposedly "driverless" car, where it turned out to be just a guy in there).

Why is it of such uniformly bad quality? And why has this become pretty much the only real new construction of homes in this country? Also in this episode: another re-discovered song from Johannes Vonk and the Clogheads.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210715 - Balthasar Speedboat v.2.0 feat Nish Kumar and Olga Koch.mp3</link>
<description>All riffs, no plot, no prior planning, and a long digression about a dog with a huge dick. It's Balthasar Speedboat yet again, this time featuring Riley, Milo, Olga, and friend of the show Nish Kumar. You will enjoy it! And you will learn a lot about Canadian malls.</description>

<description>It's the free one!
This week, it’s Riley, Milo, Alice, and Nate discussing a startup that will make it even easier for you to not own a home, the dreaded ‘football situation’ in England, the UK government’s plans to end all COVID distancing measures, and a dicey situation in the US state of Maine involving self-declared MILFs.</description>

<description>This week, we're discussing a few things: weird academy schools in Britain that want to do performative draconian discipline, a startup that is, uh, child-centric, and much more. We are pleased to welcome Devon from Kill James Bond and Da Youtube Zone to give us their perspective as a former teacher, and pharaoh-tier riffs.</description>

This week, we're discussing Secret Cinema's plan to crowfund investor capital, the fact that Secret Cinema did a performance in Kabul in 2011, a Tory Lord being criticised for corruption (shocker), our pre-election take on Batley &amp; Spen, and much more. Riley is on a fancy holiday so this episode is a gathering of Milo, Hussein, Nate, and Alice. Hope you enjoy!</description>

<description>This week, we've rounded up our favorite historians and subjected them to yet another absolutely terrible movie--this time it's Ridley Scott's 'Robin Hood,' a nearly 150-minute long film that sucks. Who could not say they loved a long digression into the Magna Carta's origins or a sequence we can only call Medieval Saving Private Ryan? You will enjoy this.</description>

This week, we’ve got Jesse Farrar and Mike Hale of the Your Kickstarter Sucks podcast to discuss Kickstarter as a business, the weird and deeply unethical stuff that crowdfunding platforms get away with, and much more. However, we would be remiss if we didn’t also include recent British news--particularly of the horny type.</description>

<description>Okay, okay, maybe you've heard the term 'posh' or 'posho' when referring to fancy British people. You're aware that this country has a reputation for its class system. But what does it actually mean? To answer this question, we brought in TF founding cohost and knower of fancy tendencies Charlie Palmer to discuss. It's all here: getting ripped at 11 am on Dubonnet, wearing a straw hat every day at school, absurd nicknames, gibberish words for everyday items, and the profound sorrow of clinging to the cultural artefacts of feudalism.</description>

<description>A lot going on here! We review the recent by-election in Amersham and Chesham, the upcoming election in Batley and Spen (both of which have yielded brain god predictions from Britain's press), review an ode to Zoom by normal shaped head haver and VC elder statesman Marc Andreesen, and speak with the FT's Jamie Powell about what appears to be yet another politically connected weird fraud company.

<description>It's the free one!
We speak with comedian Josie Long (@josielong) about a recent article in the Atlantic about whether or not Boris Johnson is Britain’s Trump. It’s a terrible article by a guy who knows nothing about Britain, but we wanted to get down to the individual details of why it’s just so infuriating. So, enjoy this episode where we’re in a good mental space. We also talk about a startup that, despite its name, has nothing to do with coffee.

<description>Financial journalist Alex Scaggs returns to talk about why the American treat based economy has strained around the edges. In short - as a result of decades of a sclerotic and implacable elite unable to get beyond their ideological commitments to shareholders, the US and UK are experiencing sky high prices, shortages of crucial goods, catastrophic misallocation of resources. But first, we talk about a "Synthetic Biology" company that's got some fun ideas about The New Flesh.</description>

This week we have a packed studio featuring Riley, Milo, Hussein, Alice, and friend of the show Juliet Jacques (@zinovievletter) to discuss her new book Variations. However, we also discuss trouble in SoftBank world, a BBC article about how humans will evolve into two bifurcated species of Virgin and Chad, and--hence the title--a recent brain-melt Quillette article about how apparently anime and Magic: the Gathering make you trans.

<description>This week, we're discussing Years &amp; Years again. We simply couldn't cram two episodes into this round because there was so much going on--we want to get rid of our arms and legs, or replace our eyes with the light spectrum somehow--and so we gave this Lib Dem dystopian vision the attention it deserves. You may recognise Devon's voice from Da YouTube Zone and the Kill James Bond podcast, because they're back on to make it even spicier.</description>

We also talk about terrible UK local news, how to read the temperature of the nation from Facebook comments, and much more.</description>

This week we're joined by Aron Keller (@aronkeller) of the anti-occupation advocacy group Na'amod to discuss the recent events in Gaza and the communications strategies (particularly the deranged ones) of the Israeli government.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210514 - Britainology 15_ The Cambridge Spies.mp3</link>
<description>During World War II and the early Cold War there were a group of English intelligence operatives who spied for the Soviet Union. All of them basically walked around with huge neon signs attached to them that said 'I am a spy for the Soviet Union,' but due to the diamond-hard class solidarity of Britain's establishment, everyone forced themselves to not notice this. We brought on Alice to discuss the Cambridge Spies and we hope you enjoy it.</description>

<description>(This is 'The Free One', posted early for our beloved patrons)
Ed and Jathan from This Machine Kills (@machinekillspod) are back to discuss another titan of the tech industry. Amazon's annual leader to shareholders has been released, and in it they advance a sort of inverse labour theory of value (who can be surprised!), with hilarious results. It's scale is now approaching a level that is hard to comprehend, so come with us across the event horizon. But first, we discuss Labour's performance in the elections and the leadership's steadfast ability to not learn anything.

<title>Remember When The Bin Man Was Hard?</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210511 - Remember When The Bin Man Was Hard_.mp3</link>
<description>Labour MP Jon Cruddas has written the best approximation of what can be considered “Starmerism’s offer to British workers.” While some elements - eg a job guarantee - are better than nothing (but even then, run their own risk of rebuilding a modern workhouse depending on the shape of the policy), even at best, their desirability and strategy for achieving them are based on a vision of the economy that nobody under 70 would recognise as realistic. So come on an annoying journey through Blue Labour nostalgia for proper jobs, when the bin men were hard.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210506 - I Want to Get Rid of My Arms and Legs_ TF Reviews 'Years &amp; Years' (Part 1).mp3</link>
<description>What if Black Mirror did This Is Us? What if your kid wanted to upload themselves to their dang phone? What if a Lib Dem wrote one of the worst TV dramas to ever exist? All of this, and more, in the TF review of Years and Years (episodes 1 and 2). We hope it doesn't count as a spoiler alert to say it is bad.</description>

<title>May 6th: The Cops Election</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210504 - May 6th_ The Cops Election.mp3</link>
<description>May 6th will mark regional local elections in the UK, to include the London mayoral election. Considering that 4 of the 5 of us are based in London, this does in fact affect us. However, all polling indicates that Sadiq Khan will win again on a platform of More Cops and handing all decisions to property developers, with the remaining candidates all basically wanting More Cops. Sian Berry? Bad. Laurence Fox? Don't make me laugh. Shaun Bailey? Joke. Brian Rose? Okay, he's extremely bad also, but that man is a verifiable content machine. So, we decided on a platform of 'vote if you want to do but don't really expect much either way' and then decided to talk about Brian Rose's completely bonkers life force. Hope you enjoy!

<description>This was supposed to be a hard-hitting episode with an interview about Russia and leftism in Russian politics, but we had a classic TF season 1 moment when the recording failed. So, here's what we were able to salvage from the episode, with a great review of the recent UK op-ed about feeding yourself slop to trigger the woke left. We love this island, we love the times we live in, and we (unironically) love you.</description>

<description>Andrew and Riley are joined by Dan Boeckner of Operators and The Bottlemen for the second episode of our series about the lasting cultural impact of September 11. We discuss Dan's recollection of the day, the impact that 9/11 had on the playlists of radio stations across the country, artists censoring their own songs, misguided musical output, and the only musician we can think of to create a lasting, prescient response in the form of a memorable concept album.</description>

<description>We've been very happy that you, the fans, have enjoyed Britainology so much. In an attempt to bridge the gap between our two cultures, Nate has brought on two fellow Midwesterners (Francis Horton from Hell of a Way, a native of St. Louis, Missouri; Joe Kassabian from Lions Led by Donkeys, a native of Detroit, Michigan) to flip the script on Milo. Now it's the good-natured Midwestern oafs in the driver's seat, and we explain the name of the region itself, why ICP had such appeal to our generation, and why literally everyone has a driving-while-intoxicated story involving being thrown out of someone's house.</description>

We also talk about a deeply stupid SPAC that JD Vance is hawking, and some other stuff about the whole climate thing. Yes, the guy who runs the SPAC is named Jeff W. Ubben.

However, someone who has been on this story since its inception is Financial Times journalist Rob Smith (@BondHack), and he's on the show today to review what's happened in this big ol' mess-er-idoo.

<title>Waiting for Lordstown feat. Bryan Quinby</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210413 - Waiting for Lordstown feat. Bryan Quinby.mp3</link>
<description>“We’re bringing the jobs back!” has long been the rallying cry of the right, but what kinds of businesses are actually coming back to places like Lordstown, Ohio? We are joined by Bryan Quinby (@murderxbryan) of Street Fight Radio to do a deep dive on Lordstown Motors - a “too good to be true” electric car manufacturer that has set up shop in the town of the same name. It’s all well and good when rich people take money off one another, but what about the workers who believe their lives are getting back on track?
The primary source for this episode was this report published by short seller Hindenburg Research, which also similarly exposed Nikola. https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/</description>

<description>We sat down with Leslie Kern (@LellyK)--feminist geographer, academic, and author of Feminist City: Claiming Space in a Man-Made World--to discuss what it means that "a feminist city is a police free city," in the wake of a slew of misogynistic, racist, and otherwise generally brutal actions attributed to London's finest. First, though, we take a look with some satisfaction at Deliveroo's shoddy IPO performance.

<description>(This is this week's free episode -- we've listened to your requests and are now hosting the free episodes on here as well)
This week, we’re joined by Sam Knight of the District Sentinel (@TheDCSentinel) to discuss a U.S. Supreme Court case that may make it even harder for union organizers to meet with farm labourers in the US. With the exceptionally rational and normal composition of the Court, chances are good that this could make things even worse. We also discuss Prince Harry becoming the chief engagement officer at a mental health startup in the US, because why wouldn’t he.
If you want to read Sam’s article, it’s available here: https://truthout.org/articles/supreme-court-case-on-farmworker-protections-could-end-up-harming-all-regulation/

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20210301 - Britainology 11_ Cursed Architecture feat. India Block.mp3</link>
<description>Why is it that this island in the North Atlantic has such shit buildings? What is the reason for slapping gravel on buildings and calling it an aesthetic? Why did Britain sell off most of it social housing and make it functionally impossible to replace it? All this, and more, explored on yet another Britainology -- this one featuring architecture critic India Block (@indiablock)</description>

<description>It's time once again for Britainology, and this week Milo and Nate are joined by Phoebe Roy (who you have have heard on Masters of Our Domain and 10,000 Posts) to discuss British 9/11. Do we mean 7/7? The 2011 riots? No, we mean the death of the Queen of Our Hearts, Princess Diana Spencer, in August 1997. Never has a nation freaked out more, and we provide the key to understanding it all.</description>

<description>There's this mysterious land called Terra Australis where the government has taken a slightly different approach to the US and UK, and as a result they have relatively normal life right now. It's the height of summer and they're enjoying their lives, and we managed to get friends of the show Tom Walker and Aidan 'Taco' Jones to discuss a variety of things with us.

<description>This week, a nearly complete cast of Riley, Milo, Nate, and Alice speak with Jessica Eaton, a fine art photographer working in Montreal. Why is it that the art world is basically a billionaire tax dodge? Why do certain hedge funds seem to have so much weight in fine art purchases, even if the works are never shown? What the hell is going on? Learn more by listening to this episode.

<description>This is it. The last straw. The final bone.
Andrew and Riley are here one last time for the final episode of season 5 of Bones. No other season of the show exists as far as we know.  Join us as the writers of Bones basically give up one last time and send Bones to Indonesia, send Booth to Afghanistan and send Angela and Hodgins to fuck in ZZ Top's car.  Thank you for joining us on this strange and perplexing journey into mid 2000s post-9/11 network television.</description>

Why do people care about these rocks in the middle of the South Atlantic? Why did a British task force commander decide to explode himself in order to dislodge a machine gun position? You will be able to learn all of this and more by listening.</description>

What an absurd concept to declare that 85 million people had watched it.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20201123 - Tom Watson's House of Pain feat. Nish Kumar.mp3</link>
<description>How to explain this? Tom Watson--yes, THAT Tom Watson--has written a 'taut, political thriller' about what if Labour and the Tories came together to make sure NHS patient data was sold to pharmaceutical companies in an ethical way. It's deeply boring in a manner that reflects its author, but it's also something else: an experience. Riley read the whole book and forced Nish Kumar to listen to it along with Milo, Hussein, and Alice. Hope you enjoy!</description>

Mars. Where else in the solar system are you going to live?

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20201111 - The Boney Island Whitefish in_ Bone in Your Lane for Love.mp3</link>
<description>It's a spooky, scary Halloween special that Riley and Andrew accidentally recorded pretty close to Halloween! Bones and the gang from the Jeffersonian Medico Institute for Sexual Harassment investigate the mysterious death of a real witch, where they briefly consider whether actual magic may play a part? Plus, a safety feature on the 2009 Toyota Prius leads to an unexpected jailhouse romance in The B Plot.</description>

<description>It's been a while, but we've brought it back: our non-stop comedy riff series returns with Riley, Milo, and special guests Glenn Moore and Pierre Novellie. Riley posits the argument that 'The History Boys' is the actual true 20th century British artistic work. We also discuss airport novels and whole lot more. Sorry for the delay!</description>

<description>It's time to investigate the death of God! Also, there's a Breakfast Update bookended with Dinner Updates. And after all that, we find out that Agent Booth truly loves "rock and roll". But how will the team from the Jeffersonian-Medico Institute for Sexual Harassment solve this mystery with only 42 minutes to spare?</description>

<description>Riley did the unthinkable. The unimaginable. He read Matt Forde's terrible book 'Politically Homeless' for us and described it to an all star cast of Riley, Alice, and special guests Bryn and Chris from the Beep Beep Lettuce podcast (@weedpod). You will love it, but not as much as Matt Forde loves Tony Blair.</description>

Also, is a phone box in rural Winchester the new world epicentre of the BLM movement? According to one brain poisoned conservative columnist, it is! Local hi-jinx abound.</description>

<description>We brought on Riley to discuss a phenomenon as eternally British as bad weather itself: the legend. Who are British legends? What makes them act this way? How do you create a taxonomy of figures to distinguish between the Essex Geezer, the Entrepreneurial Legend, the High Street Hard Man, and Tim Westwood? Well, we gave it our best go.</description>

However, to involve the incredible financial chicanery that went into it, we brought on friend of the show Quantian1 (@quantian1) to discuss it with Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Alice.</description>

<description>This week, we're talking Dilbert and Scott Adams. Why? Well, for some reason all five of us liked Dilbert as a kid. Also, it just so happens that friend of the show Aisling McCrea (@ambientGillian) just published an article in Current Affairs about Dilbert's strange appeal. So, let's talk about it. Let's talk about Scott Adams' promise that he can make you no-touch cum. Let's dilb out.

Specifically, how if you’re Bill Gross, one of the world’s most famous bond investors, you’ll react to your acrimonious divorce in 2015 by writing a series of stranger and stranger investment outlooks that focus mainly on how much you hate your imbecilic do-nothing son.</description>

<description>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a country run by and for landlords. However, the coronavirus crisis has created a problem: if people congregate en masse in offices and places of business, the disease spreads and people die! However, mitigating this requires people to not be in offices or grim city centre restaurants. So, what is the British commentator class saying about it? Die for Pret. That's right folks, you need to die for Pret.</description>

<description>Here it is: the song you have all requested. The sound of the summer. The perfect musical accompaniment for standing on the honk.
[breaking out of irony mode for a second] I can't express in words how much I appreciate the positive reception that this has gotten. Milo and I put in some absurdly long hours working on this, mostly because--like anyone else on planet earth who isn't a piece of garbage--we haven't exactly had a great time these past few months and it's been nice to find some sort of an outlet for it.

This week the brave technicians at the Jeffersonian-Medico Institute for Sexual Harassment are forced to investigate the cause of death of a very mysterious and influential historical figure! Deep respect for the boots of the American empire is sure to follow.

<description>This is the follow up to this week's free episode, which is available here: https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/e/a-cheeky-coup-with-the-lads-feat-joe-kassabian/
Why did a steely-eyed SAS veteran Etonian weirdo team up with Margaret Thatcher's son to try and launch a coup in Equatorial Guinea in 2004? Mostly because they were bored. In this episode we discuss the consequences of a dumb plot that was foiled by an errant bird and the Zimbabwean customs office.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200807 - Keanu Reeves Predicted 5G Corona.mp3</link>
<description>This week, we're in the Super Chaos Configuration: Riley is gone but you have the rest of the cast. Milo, Hussein, Nate, and Alice review the 1995 Robert Longo film JOHNNY MNEMONIC, an adaptation of a William Gibson story that, uh, did not achieve its goals. And yet it's also weirdly accurate in some ways: posting destroys your brain, there's a global pandemic, corporations rule with an iron fist. And yet somehow we haven't yet encountered a cybernetic hacker junkie dolphin. If only.

<title>Britainology 2: The Noble Football Hooligan</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200730 - Britainology 2_ The Noble Football Hooligan.mp3</link>
<description>This week, Nate and Milo are discussing the 2005 film Green Street Hooligans, in which an American played by Elijah Wood goes to Britain and gets inducted into a football firm, learning a lot about himself along the way. Is it a good movie? No. But does it accurately portray football hooliganism? Also no.</description>

<title>Fancy Art for Fancy Lads feat. Josie Long</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200724 - Fancy Art for Fancy Lads feat. Josie Long.mp3</link>
<description>Sorry for the delayed release on this. During the recording we were convinced that we'd lost the entire Josie segment, so we recorded a second half that's almost the same length. As such, this is a long one, but I think you'll enjoy. It involves the elitism of the art world, Josie Long's commentary on the way in which the entire world is gatekept by the rich, and the second segment features a guy calling his billionaire friend for advice about the state of the world. The advice, as you might expect, is normal as hell.

<description>Flora Gill and Amber Rudd have a mother-daughter podcast. Does it suck? Yes. But it's also awkward and painful in a way that will make you see through time and enter the Hell Dimension. We made Riley, Milo, Alice, and Olga listen to it. You won't believe what happened next!

<title>Britainology Episode 1: A Clump from Dave Courtney</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200710 - Britainology Episode 1_ A Clump from Dave Courtney.mp3</link>
<description>Welcome to the inaugural episode of Britainology, in which Milo makes Nate watch something terminally British and then explains it. This week, we're watching a documentary about self-described celebrity gangster Dave Courtney, a crime doorman who thinks he runs Britain.
If you want to watch the original documentary, it's available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqARxpCpZU4
Our theme song for this series is from the 'Visit to Primrose Hill Extended Version' of the 1993 Blur song 'For Tomorrow,' which Nate picked because it was formative in teaching him various aspects of London geography and it's premium old millennial / young gen xer nostalgia bait. You can listen to it on Spotify here: https://open.spotify.com/track/3mvdN3a4p4SaOnpUBGWan2?si=B8IQ7g1PSfGqFw_P1dSY9Q</description>

<description>Was it a good idea? Probably not. But we've assembled the Balthasar Speedboat cast of Riley, Milo, Olga, and Pierre for a friendly conversation with chaos demon and influencer Caroline Calloway...who Milo knows from school...and you know what? Just listen to the episode to hear him get eviscerated for his acne and an awkward attempt at a kiss. You'll love it! Or you'll hate it.</description>

<description>Riley and Andrew are back to discuss the collapse of late-2000s network television during the rise of streaming, the provincial local media of Australia and the UK, competing bagel franchises, horny grandpas in fetish clubs and spontaneous human combustion. 
All in a day's work for the internet's only podcast about season 5 of American crime procedural comedy-drama television series Bones.</description>

<description>We're back with now 3-time guest Olly Thorn (@philosophytube) to discuss some recent scandals: the Jenrick building scandal, the scandal of weird British porn mags, and the scandal of a terrible "discussion app" that seems to think it's a debatable point that Paul McCartney is in fact still alive.

It's a six-way Brendan O'Neill battle moderated by the only man who could possibly moderate a clash of intellectual titans like this: Brendan O'Neill. It may sound like @inthesedeserts, @raaleh, @Hkesvani, @AliceAvizandum, @milo_edwards, @rocknrolga, and our friend Phoebe Roy (@10kpostspod), but we must insist it is all Brendan O'Neill.
They are debating the motion: THB the chattering classes of this once great nation are at it again.</description>

<description>Riley and Andrew have swum gently upstream to once again bring you an episode of the Boney Island Whitefish.
What if this murder victim was a DARPA-created hybrid human-avian killing machine? They almost definitely aren't, but imagine if they were! These are the important things that the writers of this episode of Bones want you to very briefly consider, before forgetting about that plotline. Will Angela break her volcel commitment? Does workplace exposure to sulphites change the shape of your skull? Will the murderer have a motive that isn't revealed in the last 2 minutes of the show? Find out the answers in this week's Boney Island Whitefish!</description>

<description>We talked to Robyn Vinter of the Overtake about Culture War - what actually is it, what purpose does it serve, and why won't it end? The answer is "spite," but how we get there is more interesting. We also read an article by one of our favourite journalists on why his mission to Own The Libs may result in him losing a foot to diabetes, which is kind of like WWII when you think about it.

<title>The Boney Island Whitefish in: Bones, James Bones</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200514 - The Boney Island Whitefish in_ Bones, James Bones.mp3</link>
<description>BoontaVista's Andrew (@IllyBocean) and our very own Riley (@raaleh) are back for episode 2 of the fifth season of Bones for @BoneyIslandPod, in which network television is brave enough to ask the question "what if James Bond was real and also very bad at being a spy but it was hard to solve his murder because your bad case of Coma Brain makes you forget how plumbing works?"</description>

<title>Frankenstein's Balance Sheet</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200514 - Frankenstein's Balance Sheet.mp3</link>
<description>There's a ticking time bomb in the economy. No, a DIFFERENT ticking time bomb. This week, Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Alice discuss the balance-sheet chicanery of a mysterious Australian plane enthusiast that is slowly but surely imploding every SoftBank investment vehicle. We would normally say it's a laugh riot, but this one... maybe not so much.</description>

<description>Hey! This patron-exclusive Boonta Vista/Trashfuture collaboration is the first episode of an extremely specific podcast-within-a-podcast in which Andrew and Riley recap episodes of season 5 of the American crime procedural comedy-drama Bones. 
In this episode we explain the origins of Bones, why season 5 of Bones is worth examination, and the season premiere which includes Psychic Cyndi Lauper, Poopie Suits, brain surgery-induced coma hallucinations, underwater cults, fake diseases, clowns and much more.</description>

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200507 - Microsoft Rocks feat. Rob Larson.mp3</link>
<description>This week we're talking tech monopolies and the ways in which Gates and Bezos used public research to become this century's dumber Carnegie and Vanderbilt. Listen to Riley, Milo, and Alice discuss it with Rob Larson (@IronicProfessor), and rejoice in the knowledge that everything you've ever done with a PC was planned out by dudes in rocking chairs for some reason.

<description>Riley, Alice, Milo, and Chapo Trap House's Felix Biederman have once again sat down and cracked open a book of brain literature. This time we read through British brain god Dr. Matt Ridley's The Rational Optimist (2010), and it left us all a lot happier as we explored a truly beautiful mind. It's a balm for the soul.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200427 - Riley's Commie Night Club (ft. Nathalie Olah, Jesse Bernard, and Tom Usher).mp3</link>
<description>Riley's Commie Book Club is (sort of) back... but a little different. Instead of talking about a book, Riley is joined by some old friends and new to talk about nightlife - what is nightlife, why is it important, and what are the economic and social factors that threaten the continued existence of "nightlife" as something valuable? Or maybe the four of us are on the wrong end of 25 and assuming it's all bad now.
Also, this was recorded before the end of the world - so many of the pressures facing nightlife have uhhh changed, but they aren't going anywhere! Anyway, maybe this is hauntology now. We'll be doing a normal "Riley reads a book episode" again soon, though!</description>

<description>Look, you know we couldn't let some simpering right-wing columnists refer to the body of Boris Johnson as coterminous with the state itself and not bring on our sage of all things medieval, Dr Eleanor Janega (@goingmedieval). We talk all about this, all about the societal changes after the Black Plague, and a dumb startup that is basically a less-fun Omegle.

Another movie about empire, except this time it's about a horny congressman who manages to give Al Qaeda a billion dollars. Yep, it's the 2007 Tom Hanks romp CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, written by Aaron fucking Sorkin. Please enjoy.

You’ll hear Riley (@raaleh), Milo (@Milo_Edwards), Hussein (@HKesvani), and Nate (@inthesedeserts) join special guest Angie Speaks (@speaksangie) to discuss an app that retroactively places products in existing films -- who hasn’t wanted to get ads for Casper Mattresses when watching 1970s noir films -- and a long story about a man who wants to remake Bishop Auckland in his own, uh, slightly vampiric image.</description>

Well, we've brought on an academic philosopher and friend of the show Nathan Oseroff-Spicer (@nathanoseroff) to break down Scruton's work in detail. And guess what? It's... interesting.

<description>Did you hear about the app that wants to 3D model your face to make sure you're a girl? It's called Giggle and we do not approve of it. In this episode Riley, Hussein, Alice, and artist Matt Lubchansky (@lubchansky) also discuss Mayor Pete, the US democratic primary, and much more. We thought about calling this episode 'ISIS for Girls' but Alice got to choose the title after she completely evaporated Riley's brain by reading test copy from Pete Buttigieg's website. Don't worry -- we recorded it all.

<description>It's the (belated) January edition of Riley's Commie Book Club! Riley spoke with author, academic, and labour activist Callum Cant on his book Riding for Deliveroo: Resistance in the New Economy. We get into algorithmic management, the insipid patronising internal PR of tech companies, what it's really like to ride for Deliveroo, and the new forms of solidarity emerging from precarious work.
Buy Callum's book! Here's a link: https://housmans.com/product/riding-for-deliveroo/

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20200116 - This Episode Brought To You By The Letter B feat. Soweto Kinch.mp3</link>
<description>And on the pedestal, these words appear: 'bung a bob for Big Ben to bong for Brexit.' This accursed phrase has melted our brains, and you get to hear it happen in real time on this episode. It's a mass gathering of Riley, Milo, Nate, Alice, Olga, and special guest Soweto Kinch (@sowetokinch), and things get weird. We hope you'll love this episode as much as we hate being alive after reading the material that went in to it.

<description>It's the chaos configuration of Riley, Milo, and Alice on this week's bonus episode (Nate and Hussein were busy being boring lames). We're talking about the assassination of Qassem Soleimani and the tragic hilariousness of America's constant self-sabotage when it tries to do imperialism.

<description>This week, we’re reviewing a startup called WhiteHat, digesting a terrible Giles Coren wankfest about Oxford admissions, and—most importantly—speaking to friend of the show and biology teacher Devon (@Devon_OnEarth) about the state-mandated ‘British Values’ education.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20191221 - Takfir and Loathing_ TF Reviews 'Body of Lies' (2008).mp3</link>
<description>Look, maybe we just needed a break. Maybe there's nothing particularly good to talk about politically in this moment of elected dictatorship. However, we can talk about trash culture and the cult of super-smart drones, and as such we've reviewed the 2008 Ridley Scott film 'Body of Lies,' which is bad. Why does Leo DiCaprio dress like a podcaster? Why are there basically zero Arab actors in major roles in this film? Why is Russell Crowe such a weird Foghorn Leghorn ass guy? Listen to hear our takes on this, and much more.</description>

<description>You wake up. You turn on your computer to do Fiverr jobs until breakfast. You go to your job. Your contract is secure for another two weeks. You buy lunch for a tenner because you can't go on. You come home, exhausted. It's time for your next job. And you have to pay seven kinds of bills. You've become a burned out husk of a person. But now there's an exciting new venture capital backed startup called Pattern that wants to change all that with luxury cookware somehow. Riley, Milo, Alice, and special guest Nathalie Olah go deep on this strange new theory of change, and why maybe more start ups aren't the answer?

<description>It's that time again! Riley's Commie Book Club is back a brief hiatus. This month, we're discussing Stafford Beer's lecture series "Designing Freedom." Beer, one of the principal architects of Cybersyn, the information network that served as the nerve centre for Allende's Chile, spent his life thinking of ways that people could organise to solve common problems in ways that do not create pointless hierarchies between them. Check it out!
I reference an episode of the podcast 99&#37; Invisible here, and I promise I would link it. So! That episode: here.</description>

Cheese tokens instead of paying its workers; Amazon killing people in its fulfillment centres and deciding that actually, this is fine; and the truly most yer da thing in existence, a ‘satirical’ Brexit disco album that’s truly on the outer limits of bad.

On this week’s bonus, Riley, Hussein, and Alice are in discussion with writer and journalist Kieran Yates (@kieran_yates) on the topic of terrible internships, terrible models of home ownership, and much more. Did you know that Hussein has Trashfuture on his CV? Maybe everyone should put it on their CV, even the listeners. You’ll love it, folks!</description>

<description>We took Trashfuture on the road, opening up the start of of the Birmingham Transformed festival. The cast was Riley, Hussein, Nate, and returning guest Soweto Kinch. We talked about a high-tech eugenics platform and a news site that might as well be the QAnon Onion. You'll love it as much as we did, friends.

<description>We did it. We drove from London to Edinburgh with all our equipment in tow, climbed a fucking medieval staircase in a downpour, got soaked to the damn bones, and then played a (sold out!!!!) show at the Edinburgh Fringe. We only had a 50 minute time slot, so this was a short one. Thank you so much to all the fans who came out in the garbage weather to see it.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190801 - Riley's Commie Book Club - Blindsight.mp3</link>
<description>It's Commie Book Club's new home! This month, Riley changes gears a little bit from the theoretical to discuss one of his favourite works of Science Fiction, Blindsight by Peter Watts. It's a hard-sci fi first contact novel that is so hard it has citations. Only very minor spoilers contained herein - you are encouraged to read it!
Find it on Watts' website, where he posted it free on his website after a dispute with his publisher.

It was so bad, so painfully long-form and weird, that we had to convene a session of Balthasar Speedboat to discuss it. So, we brought on Riley, Milo, Olga, Alex Kealy, and Rajiv Karia (@RajivAKaria). Hope you enjoy it! If not, we're breaking up with you (in over 1000 words).</description>

<description>Tony Blair, what a guy! Am I right, folks? He can't stop whining about how we need fewer houses and more apps. He can't stop pointing a finger at the Labour party and saying that it was better when we were pro-privatisation and pro-bombing. And now, of course, his institute has a great plan -- a policy paper full of nothing but management consultant speak -- with one sole defined policy goal: national ID cards. Yes, he still wants them.

<title>Riley's Commie Book Club - Imagined Communities</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190627 - Riley's Commie Book Club - Imagined Communities.mp3</link>
<description>It’s that time again! This month Riley is reading Benedict Anderson’s graduate seminar standby Imagined Communities. The “nation” is a concept much beloved of reactionaries and dismissed by Marxists as mere ideology. But it has serious psychological power nevertheless. Anderson’s book asks what is a “nation,” where did it come from, and how has the concept been used and misused over time? Riley then applies Anderson’s rubric to understanding the swell of white nationalism that has erupted in the West since the end of the Cold War.

<description>The UK can't get enough of border forces. We want to fund them in our own country and in other countries, even when those countries want visa-free regional travel. We love making everyone a cop, and we're joined this week by Zoe Gardner (@ZoeJardiniere) from Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (@JCWI_UK) to discuss this.
However, we also have a terrible startup to review, and a great (by which we mean insane) article about why National Service would be a good thing. It's bad, folks!

<description>America desperately wants to go to war with Iran, so much that it's willing to engineer some extremely fake circumstances under which it can claim to be the victim of aggression. Why is that? Well, according to Bret Stephens, it's because they hate Ben Franklin, or something. To discuss this, we bring on Sina Rahmani, host of the The East is a Podcast, and ask him why the US can't seem to stop broadcasting its war horniness.

<title>Riley's Commie Book Club - Marxism and the Philosophy of Science: A Critical History</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190516 - Riley's Commie Book Club - Marxism and the Philosophy of Science_ A Critical History.mp3</link>
<description>Another instalment of Riley's Commie Book Club delivered to you, our delightful and beloved patrons. This month, Riley decided to take it in a bit of a different direction, and talk about an under-discussed field of study, Marxism and the Philosophy of Science. How should we think about knowledge, what is knowable, and how these questions are related to history and power? To get to these questions, he reads from Helena Sheehan's Marxism and the Philosophy of Science: A Critical History.
The focus of the book is on charting Marxist approaches to the philosophy of science from Engels to the mid 20th century, and while this is interesting, Riley focuses more on the underlying concepts.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190509 - President Jake Paul's Heated Moments feat. Chris Stokel-Walker.mp3</link>
<description>Everyone knows YouTube: the place where you can watch Peppa Pig get beheaded, watch crocodiles turn into chickens, learn about why earth is flat, and so much more. However, YouTube as a cultural phenomenon has created an entire new generation of public figures — a bunch of damn celebrities — and this week Hussein, Milo, and Nate speak with author Chris Stokel-Walker (@stokel) about his new book "YouTubers: How YouTube shook up TV and created a new generation of stars."
You can buy the book here: https://www.canburypress.com/store/p28/-YouTubers-book-by-Chris-Stokel-Walker.html
Also, this episode features a preview of a crossover feature on Nate's podcast What a Hell of a  Way to Die: Riley and Nate discuss Warhammer 40k and why it has such cachet among weird internet reactionaries.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190502 - Trashfuture Presents_ Balthasar Speedboat 4.mp3</link>
<description>It was a special kind of Sunday morning in London, and the whole gang gathered to record yet another episode of our comedy special Balthasar Speedboat. This round features Riley, Milo, Nate, Olga, Alex Kealy, and Pierre Novellie--and covers important topics like: what if the Hubble telescope saw God's pussy? What happens when the bullied becomes the bully? What is a samovar? And why is it that kids always find something to rip on you about? Hope you enjoy.</description>

<description>This week, Riley, Milo, and Hussein speak with writer Karen Geier (@karengeier) about Butt-mentum—the sudden ubiquity of Pete Buttigieg—as well as other topics to include the Extinction Rebellion protests and an *insane* denunciation of Heathrow Airport by a man writing for Conservative Woman. It's good, folks.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190411 - TF Live at Bristol Transformed feat. Jack Frayne-Reid and Dalia Gebrial.mp3</link>
<description>This is it, folks. The first live recording with our mobile space station, the first outside-London show, and the first leftist UK politics supergroup podcast featuring Dalia Gebrial of Novara Media and Jack Frayne-Reid of Reel Politik Podcast. Recorded live at Hamilton House, Stokes Croft, Bristol on April 5, 2019, it's a show about the things that matter: brain scanning helmets that write musical symphonies, Bristol's slave-trade past, its devotion to one particular slave-trading city father, and the local Illuminati that worship him like a god.</description>

<title>Big Bang Gamergate Theory feat. Eleanor Penny</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190404 - Big Bang Gamergate Theory feat. Eleanor Penny.mp3</link>
<description>Americans love the Big Bang Theory, even if they think they're above it (when we watched an episode in studio, Nate couldn't keep himself from laughing). But why is it so oblivious to the horrors of true nerd culture? Because as special guest Eleanor Penny (@eleanorkpenny) points out, there's already an insanely misogynist show lurking under its adorkable exterior.
In addition, we also discuss Suella Braverman MP's recent use of the term 'Cultural Marxism,' and its origins in Nazi ideology.

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190328 - Titania McGrath Tells You You're Smart [ASMR] feat. Dalia Gebrial.mp3</link>
<description>Amazing how Titania McGrath, a fictional account that owns Millennials by making dad jokes, is the talk of the London Media. It's almost like the account is run by two middle-aged Tories whose friends all RT them out of a sense of obligation. This week, Riley, Milo, and Nate speak with Novara Media's Dalia Gebrial ( @daliagebrial ) about the Titania McGrath 'phenomenon,' and why it speaks to the deeply conservative cornerstones of horniness and hurt feelings.

<description>It’s that time again: Riley sat down with a book, and now you have to hear him talk about it for an hour or so. This month, Riley read K-Punk, out now on Repeater Books. K-Punk collects the previously unpublished writing of British left cultural, political, and social critic Mark Fisher, who explored realism and imagination, future and memory, and the freedom to imagine better worlds.</description>

<description>We're back in the saddle for yet another edition of Balthasar Speedboat. This episode features Riley, Milo, Nate, Alex Kealy, Olga Koch, and Pierre Novellie -- and covers the usual spectrum of topics (but mostly Michael Jackson). Did you know Riley apparently sheds hair as a defensive mechanism? Did you know that Richard Nixon was convinced that gays brought down the Roman Empire? All this can be yours, and more.</description>

<description>We did it. We got Jonn Elledge  @JonnElledge  and Alice Caldwell-Kelly ( @AliceAvizandum) on the same podcast to discuss the UK's housing shortage, dorm-style accommodations being packaged as 'solutions,' some polycule chat, and a new VC-backed attempt to undercut Transport for London (and steal your data). This is a good one folks, hope you enjoy it.

<description>When was the last time you looked at Bill Gates, a man who had bangs well into his forties, and said, 'He's got the solution to our problems'? Well, as it just so happens, there are clearly enough Bill-lievers to necessitate an annual philanthropy fanzine, which we managed to get a hold of.
Recorded live at the Star of Kings, this episode features friend of the show and founding member Charlie Palmer, a strung-together sound system, the errant noises of Nate crouching behind the DJ booth to eat a burger, and much more.
Thank you so much to all the real heads who came out to see us live!

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190216 - Hostile Environment for Flip Phones feat. Victor Patrascan.mp3</link>
<description>Does it surprise anyone that the Tories would decide that the issue of EU citizens in the UK could be solved with an app? And does it surprise anyone that that app doesn't work? In this week's bonus episode, comedian Victor Patrascan — recently of Romania — joins the Trashfuture crew to discuss the Samsung-only immigration policy. We also discuss a very dumb article about Vene-freaking-zuela.
This episode features a TF first: reporting segments that Hussein and Nate conducted —featuring Maria Llorente from the EU citizens' advocacy group The 3 Million, and with Chicago-based app developer Ryan Jones — because guess what, folks? We've invented the news.

<description>It's that time again! Riley read a book, drank some wine, and is ready to talk about it to you fine people. This month, we're looking at State of Insecurity by Isabell Lorey, available now on Verso. It's all about precariousness and how neoliberalism has turned us into our own disciplinarians.

<description>It was admittedly a shock to all of us that any of you liked our previous Balthasar Speedboat show. However, you did, and as such we've decided to revisit it with a new episode. You can hear Riley, Milo, Olga, Alex Kealy, and Charlie Palmer for a near hour of riffs. Did you know the British had a song in World War II dedicated to Hitler's balls? Did you know that's actually body shaming? All this and more, on Balthasar Speedboat.</description>

Riley, Hussein, Milo, and Alice join special guest George Eaton, deputy editor at the New Statesman for a discussion of the HBO / Channel 4 feature film 'Brexit' starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings.
Sure, it's bad, but is that really so surprising? We delve into it with the keen insights that you've come to expect from us.

<title>The Blurst Is Yet to Come feat. Peter Fleming</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190120 - The Blurst Is Yet to Come feat. Peter Fleming.mp3</link>
<description>In this week's bonus, Riley's Commie Book Club is a bit different. This time, Riley speaks with scholar and author Peter Fleming — you might recognize the name from a previous episode discussing his book 'The Death of Homo Economicus' — and this time they cover the subject of Peter's new book, 'The Worst Is Yet to Come: A Post-Capitalist Survival Guide.'

<title>Reports from TERF Island feat. Edie Miller</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20190104 - Reports from TERF Island feat. Edie Miller.mp3</link>
<description>In this week's bonus episode, Nate interviews writer and extreme Trashfuture Tolerator Edie Miller (@multiplebears) about her recent article in the Outline, in which she asks a crucial question: why is UK media so transphobic? Their discussion covers the strangeness of the TERF argument, the weird way in which it has more currency among liberals in the UK than in the US, and much more.
You can read Edie's article here: https://theoutline.com/post/6536/british-feminists-media-transphobic?zd=1&amp;zi=utvxehpk

<title>Why to Care About Politics feat. Aidan 'Taco' Jones</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181228 - Why to Care About Politics feat. Aidan 'Taco' Jones.mp3</link>
<description>So, this episode was a long time coming. Riley, Milo, and Aidan 'Taco' Jones recorded this during Edinburgh Fringe, but it's been on the back-burner for a while. Now that we're in the beloved dead space between Christmas and the New Year, we saw fit to release it. Regale yourself with a conversation in which Riley explains why you should care about politics.
If you're blessed with holidays from work, hope they're good. And if not, well, neither does our producer.</description>

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181220 - %23WeHaveBeenPubliclyShamed _ Trashfuture Q&amp;A.mp3</link>
<description>This week's bonus is the first installment of something we've been wanting to do for a while: a Q&amp;A episode. However, before we could get there, we had to read our beloved boy Toby Young's insane holiday column about his 'vertiginous' 'defenestration' from public life.
We did our best to answer your questions with a minimum of Yu Gi Oh references. Well, a relative minimum.

<title>Riley's Festive Commie Book Club: 'The End of the Transition Paradigm'</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181213 - Riley's Festive Commie Book Club_ 'The End of the Transition Paradigm'.mp3</link>
<description>For this week's particularly festive bonus, Riley reviews the academic paper 'The End of the Transition Paradigm' by Thomas Carothers. Riley discusses international relations as a discipline, his takes on some core assumptions of the genre, how it's influenced modern politics in the general Atlantic region, and much more.
You can read the article in its entirety here: https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Carothers-13-1.pdf and then tell Riley why, actually, he's wrong.</description>

<title>Trashfuture Presents: Balthasar Speedboat</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181204 - Trashfuture Presents_ Balthasar Speedboat.mp3</link>
<description>This week's bonus episode of Trashfuture is actually a pilot of sorts -- it's a comedy show we've assembled featuring an ensemble cast of Milo, Riley, Olga Koch (@rocknrolga), Pierre Novellie ( @pierrenovellie), Alex Kealy (@alexkealy), and a few bits from Nate as well.
It's a show about how to feel the snow in a sensual way, assigned names for criminals, Dilbert-esque porn banter, Adam Sandler's comedic oeuvre, and Nate discussing a repressed memory about a German magazine he read as a kid that depicted a very silly dog.
If you enjoy this, please let us know! We're on the fence about whether or not to do another one... which makes you our partners in podcasting.</description>

<title>Identity Politics for Landords</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181127 - Identity Politics for Landords.mp3</link>
<description>On this week's bonus, Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Nate discuss Steve Bannon's recent profile in the Guardian, an insane protest letter written by British landlords in opposition to the anti-homelessness nonprofit Shelter, and a terrible startup that wants to despatch fleets of pizza vans that cook your pizza on the go (badly, of course).

<description>On this week's bonus, Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Nate speak with art historian Elise Bell (@eliseybell) about her Tabloid Art History ( @TabloidArtHist ) account and why it takes serious effort to stop any creative work from getting commodified (a think we at Trashfuture know too well)...

<description>Elon Musk gifted us analytics like Prometheus gifting fire, and as such we've determined that about 40 percent of our audience is American. So, Americans (and others) -- do you want to know about the British royal family? Well, now you can, in detail, as Riley, Milo, Hussein, and Ned Donovan (@Ned_Donovan) discuss the history of Britain's terrible ruling family. This is a good episode to listen to while your valet is relocating your bed to your friends' house.</description>

Special thanks to Woke George Eaton for clarifying some details about how you get an author picture at a media publication.</description>

<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181029 - Idiocracy Was a Damn Documentary! feat. Adam Rensch.mp3</link>
<description>This is of course something of a new content type: on this week's bonus episode, Riley, Milo, Nate, and Olga (@rocknrolga) join Adam Rensch (@nachdermas) — host of the Stop/Rewind podcast — to discuss a film that burrowed itself into the American liberal worldview like a hideous, parasitical worm. That film? Idiocracy, the 2006 Mike Judge comedy that frankly sucks, but more on an ethical level than you might expect. Have you ever wanted to do Death of the Author on a shitty movie? You'd better have!

<description>This week's bonus is Riley's Commie Book Club, reviewing Chantal Mouffe's "For a Left Populism. Why are we constantly told that the status quo — i.e. neoliberal market economics  — is the natural order? Why does the centre hate socialism more than fascism? Why is it a bad thing that socialism might leave the absolute wealthiest on the planet worse off than they are in our current gilded age? And why do they want to live in orbiting space stations?

<title>EDM: Sonic Gentrification feat. Aloiso Wilmoth</title>
<link>https://ankino.xyz/trashfuture/20181001 - EDM_ Sonic Gentrification feat. Aloiso Wilmoth.mp3</link>
<description>Welcome to this week's bonus episode from Riley. You've been promised this for ages and now you're getting it: a discussion on techno as praxis. But, it's not as lame as that might sound, because Riley speaks with musician and producer Aloiso Wilmoth ( @HE_VALENCIA) about the history of techno, its DIY ethos, its Midwest American roots, and how's it's been repackaged and sold as EDM.
You can find Aloiso's music on SoundCloud here: https://soundcloud.com/he_valencian
There's a little bit of warble on the recording! We've done our best to clean it up as much as possible, but you may still notice it periodically.</description>

<description>On this week's bonus episode, Riley, Milo, and Nate sit down with former Jeremy Corbyn spokesman and extremely cool friend of the show Matt Zarb-Cousin (@mattzarb) to discuss the New European, 'a magazine for the 48 per cent.' As you might not be surprised to discover, it's actually the slightly more genteel version of those people with bitmoji avatars and 13 different hashtags in their name who always, always reply to Brexit tweets.
Make sure to listen to the end for some excellent, excellent singing on the part of the lads, who learned from this episode to drink a lot less when recording.
